# Theme Dice

(Beta) An Atom package to randomly select one of your themes for you.

It's all or nothing!


## Roll!

<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>

Randomly selects one of your themes.

## Rounds!

Schedule how often to roll the dice.

* Rounds lengths are **in seconds**
* Set to 0 for manual (**default**)

Example:

![Theme Dice settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLGoldberg/theme-dice/master/_images/theme-dice-settings.png)

(Randomly select a theme Every 3.5 minutes)

## Issues
It seems there are some conditions where Atom goofs up switching themes.
At least I think it's Atom!  Hopefully this will land into the right hands.
One way or another.

## TODO
* Return to previous theme
* Pause rounds (stay on current theme)
* Non shuffled, ordered, theme cycle
